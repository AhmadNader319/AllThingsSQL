## SQL Queries

The `sql_queries.sql` in [sql_queries.sql](sql_queries.sql) file is a learning resource showcasing different SQL `JOIN` operations and data manipulation techniques. It provides commented examples illustrating how to:

* Perform `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`, and `CROSS JOIN` to combine data based on the `product_id`.
* Filter data using `WHERE` clauses for specific conditions.
* Sort results using `ORDER BY`.
* Aggregate data with `GROUP BY` and `COUNT`.
* Handle `NULL` values for better presentation using `COALESCE`.

## SQL Subqueries:

The `sub_queries.sql` in [sub_queries.sql](sub_queries.sql) file is a learning resource showcasing sub querying operations and techniques. It provides commented examples illustrating how to:

* Filter based on scalar subqueries:
* Filter based on column subqueries (using `IN`):
* Filter based on row subqueries (using `=`):
* Filter based on table subqueries (in `FROM` clause):
* Filter based on existence (`EXISTS`)
* Filter data based on comparisons with the results of aggregate functions (like `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `SUM`, `COUNT`) calculated within a subquery.
