## SQL Queries

The `sql_queries.sql` file is a learning resource showcasing different SQL `JOIN` operations and data manipulation techniques. It provides commented examples illustrating how to:

* Perform `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `FULL OUTER JOIN`, and `CROSS JOIN` to combine data based on the `product_id`.
* Filter data using `WHERE` clauses for specific conditions.
* Sort results using `ORDER BY`.
* Aggregate data with `GROUP BY` and `COUNT`.
* Handle `NULL` values for better presentation using `COALESCE`.

By examining these queries, you can gain a better understanding of how to retrieve and analyze data from relational databases involving transactions and inventory.
